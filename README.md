## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set up your environment variables:**
Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key.

* First, copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
* Then, open the `.env` file and add your key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```
This `.env` file is ignored by Git and will not be uploaded.
